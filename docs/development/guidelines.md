# Guidelines for project developers

* Make sure you have installed all prerequisities (including Git LFS) and set up environment before working with this repository.
* Place empty `.gitkeep` file to each subdirectory in `Assets` to make sure it was tracked by Git. This is to avoid issues with meta files that are being created by Unity for each directory, even if it is empty.
